Usage
-----
Write the title (slug) of file to include. No path or extension is needed
as long as it is unique across the site.

Should be called with %% delimiters.

If do not want the included file to show up as a stand-alone page,
use headless _build options on the included file found in
https://gohugo.io/content-management/build-options/
